#  Factals README

CODE STYLE
4. Names used in the code sometimes have longer more understandable spoken names.
Comments with ":H:" to spoken names (with weird capitalization) imply their code name.
	Code names are the capital letters of the spoken names, camel-cased.
For instance: 
	'// :H: ViEW' -- When you see code name matching caps VEW, Vew
							  think the code name "View"
	'// :H: LocalPOSitioN, OKay' -- // lPosn->localPosition, ok->okay

Note "ViEW" is neither "View" nor "Vew", but both are easily determined from it.
I like to think it was named Hungarian, after Hungarian John VonNeuman

 For example, the lines:
the trick is to think the long form when you read the short form in the code
