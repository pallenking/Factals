# Factals Debugging Session Summary

## Project Overview
This is a debugging session for the Factals application, which appears to be a Swift/SceneKit-based application for creating and managing network-like structures with various visual and audio components.

## Recent Work Completed

### Bug Fixes and Improvements
Based on recent commits and current modifications:

1. **Selection Handling (`278c335c`)** - Improved handling of xr() function when nothing is selected
2. **Ball Resize Functionality (`30792c6a`)** - Fixed ball resizing behavior 
3. **Link Bug Investigation (`c6b97bf0`)** - Ongoing debugging of link-related issues
4. **LinkPort Architecture Changes (`6a49899f`, `18108c21`)** - Removed parent:Atom references from LinkPort implementation

### Current Active Changes

#### Tests01.swift
- Modified animation timing: increased `animateVBdelay` from 0.1 to 1 second
- Adjusted bulb configurations in test networks
- Updated Mirror component with additional parameters (`P:"a,v:3,l:3"`)
- Comments suggest ongoing experimentation with bulb arrangements

#### Link.swift  
- Minor documentation improvement: clarified matrix transformation comment
- Added "T (transposed into a column)" notation for better code clarity

#### PortSound.swift
- Code cleanup and reformatting
- Improved comment organization around bounding box calculations
- Maintained existing functionality while improving readability

#### VewBase.swift
- Adjusted indentation for `rotateLinkSkins` call
- Added commented-out alternative placement for link skin rotation
- Suggests ongoing investigation of timing issues with visual updates

## Project Structure
The codebase is organized into several key areas:
- **Control and App/**: Core application logic, document handling, simulation
- **Parts (of Network)/**: Network component definitions (Atoms, Links, Ports, etc.)
- **Vews (of Parts)/**: Visual representation and rendering
- **HaveNWant Networks/**: Testing and network configurations
- **SwiftUI Views/**: User interface components
- **Extensions++/**: Utility extensions and helpers

## Current State
The application appears to be in active development with focus on:
- Link rendering and animation timing
- Network component relationships and hierarchy
- Visual feedback and sound integration
- Test network configurations for debugging specific behaviors

The modifications suggest ongoing work to resolve timing and visual synchronization issues in the network simulation and rendering system.
